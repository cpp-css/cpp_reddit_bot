# CPP Reddit Bot

This is a Reddit bot for the Cal Poly Pomona subreddit.  Its goal
is to provide users information about CPP's organizations and/or
events through queries like

`!CSSbot genre Technology`

The bot will be built in Python using a Reddit API wrapper called
praw (Python Reddit API Wrapper). The bot will be gathering data
from myBar through the use of a web scraping tool called Scrapy.

For more information on PRAW and Scrapy as well as installing
Python, see the links below

Also, I recommend setting up a virtual environment (virtualenv)
for creating and running Python projects
